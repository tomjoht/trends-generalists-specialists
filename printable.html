               <li>To provide value in specialist contexts, tech writers must exploit the gaps</li>
               <li>These gaps are (1) doc tools/processes, (2) understanding user feedback/experiences, and (3) information usability</li>

                  separate steps in a pin factory), we will now see knowledge-worker jobs &mdash;
                  salesperson, secretary, engineer &mdash; atomize into complex networks of people

               The aim [of structured writing] is not to eliminate complexity altogether â€“ that is impossible â€“ but to partition it so that each part of that complexity is handled by the person or process with the knowledge, skills, and resources to handle it.

               <h3>Docs as a "theory" to test</h3>
               <blockquote>
                  In a sense, many things on a software development project are theories, or more accurately, assertions that need to be evaluated. ... Just because some stakeholders ... say a requirement is valid does not mean that they are correct. We need to evaluate even the requirements to determine whether they define the right solution to the problem at hand. &mdash; Spence and Bitner

                 * after first publication, then you start iterating
                 * doc is never done -- like Day 1 of docs
                 * problem is bandwidth for continual iteration

            <ul>
               <li>Technology is getting simpler on the front-end for end-users</li>
               <li>But the code underneath is becoming increasingly specialized/complex</li>
               <li>Tech writers are generalists, not specialists</li>
               <li>To provide value in specialist contexts, tech writers must exploit the gaps</li>
               <li>These gaps are (1) doc tools/processes, (2) understanding user feedback/experiences, and (3) information usability</li>
            </ul>

              * questions of value have been going on since the profession began
              * no clear answers, but issue becoming more apparent than ever
              * become specialists in these areas
